              Third party management of construction projects for developers, investors or tenants. The projects can range from industrial buildings to office fit-outs and will often vary from $100,000 to $100,000,000 in hard cost budgets. The assignments often commence at a feasibility stage and proceed through to occupancy. BPI will administer the projects on behalf of the owners; our service includes selection of appropriate consultants and contractors, cost consulting, payment certification, contract administration, review of changes, negotiation of contracts and general project management.

              On behalf of lenders and equity owners on a construction project, BPI Consultants will provide loan or project monitoring services during the course of a project. This service includes payment certification of the contractorâ€™s draws on a monthly basis. It may also include a general review of the construction project but does not include the day-to-day administration of the project. This is an independent review on the work of the project for the benefit of the owner or lending institution.
